// Operations in JS

//let value = 3;
//let neg = -value;
//console.log(neg);

// precedence of datatypes and some paradox of JS
//console.log("1" + 2);
//console.log(1 + "2");
//console.log("1" + 2 + 2);
//console.log(1 + 2 + "2");

// operators paradox with null as well as undefined
console.log(null>0)
console.log(null == 0)  // has different working method
console.log(null >= 0)  // logical operators convert the null to 0 hence such results.

// Strict check
console.log("2" == 2)   //checks only value 
console.log("2" === 2)  // checks value as well as data type
